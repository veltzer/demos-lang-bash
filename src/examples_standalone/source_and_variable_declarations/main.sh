# This example explores what is the relation between the 'source'
# bash builtin command and variables defined in the sourced files.
#
# NOTES:
# - you can not use the local keyword to have a local variables
# in a sourced file.
# - a sourced file can write to the variables defined by the sourcing
# file.
# - the sourcing file can see all the variables defined by the sourced
# file.
# - unless unset of course.
