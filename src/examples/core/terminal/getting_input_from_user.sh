# This is an example of how to get input from the user in bash.
# Notes:
# - the reason read works and can actually update your bash variable
# is because it is a shell builtin and not a command.

read -p "What is your name: " name
echo "your name is $name"

# ask the user to press any key
read -n 1 -p "press any key" -s
