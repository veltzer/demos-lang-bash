#!/bin/bash -u

# This is an example of how to time a bash function using the time(1)
#
# NOTES:
# - time is a shell keyword although there is also an executable (/usr/bin/time)
# to back it up if it is missing.
# - this means that 'time' should be fast.
# - 'time' executes in the same shell (see proof below)
# - the problem with time is that it is hard to get the output from time
# (see below) and this also requires running a subshell.
