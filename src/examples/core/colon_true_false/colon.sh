# This example shows that ':' is an actual command (builtin) which accepts arguments,
# does nothing and changes '$?' to '0'.
# This is very similar to 'true' (which is also a builtin).
# 'false' is similar except '$?' is changed to '1'.
# Diffences between '#' and ':'
# - '#' does not change '$?' while ':' does change '$?' to '0'.
# - '#' cannot be followed by another command on the same line with ';' while ':' can.

# this is s comment; this command will not be executed
