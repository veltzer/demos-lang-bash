#!/bin/bash -u

# There are several ways to do integer arithmetic in bash which are:
# - braces
# - let
# - expr
# - bc
#
# We compare them all here in terms of speed.
#
# Results:
# the order above is the order of speed.
# It turns out that double brances does not invoke a subshell and
# doesn't need to parse anything.
# Next is let has to parse things but still without subshell.
# expr is already doing subshell so it's slower than the first
# two methods. It also does not need to do parsing or redirection
# which makes it faster than 'bc' which is in fourth place.
# 'bc' is subshell, needs parsing, complicated, and needs piping
# which makes it the slowest.
