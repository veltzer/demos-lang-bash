my_array=("first value" "second value" "third value")

# these two work the same as far as I can tell, but they leave no space between the elements
echo "${my_array[@]}"
echo "${my_array[*]}"
# the next line does not work, as it only prints the first element of the array
# shellcheck disable=SC2128
echo "$my_array"
# you can always iterate the array and print the values one by one
for elem in "${my_array[@]}"
do
	echo "$elem"
done
echo "with printf"
printf "%s\n" "${my_array[@]}"
echo "with IFS"
( IFS=$'\n'; echo "${my_array[*]}" )
echo "print with spaces"
printf "%s " "${my_array[@]}"
